High performance computing coursework: 

The objective of this coursework is to write a high-performance parallel, object-oriented, C++ code which will solve a 2d smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) formulation of the N-S equations.

- The file "repository.log" is the git log generated under the Linux environment.
- The file "energy.txt" records the potential energy, the kinetic energy and the total energy of particles at a specific time instance.
- The file "position.txt" records the Cartesian coordinates of particles at the last time instance.
