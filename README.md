# 2d-SPH-solver
High performance computing coursework: A parallel numerical code for solving a 2d smoothed particle hydrodynamic formulation of the N-S equations.

The objective of this coursework is to write a high-performance parallel, object-oriented, C++ code which will solve the SPH problem.

The file "repository.log" is the git log generated under the Linux environment.
The file "energy.txt" records the potential energy, the kinetic energy and the total energy of particles at a specific time instance.
The file "position.txt" records the Cartesian coordinates of particles at the last time instance.
